The round-robin scheduler yields the following response and turnaround times:

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 200,100,300 -p RR -q 1
    [...]

- Response time: (0 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1
- Turnaround time: 466

Note that the response time is easy to predict, but the turnaround time is
less so because the simulator initially executes 3 jobs, then 2 after the
shortest one finishes (thus changing the time spent on each), then just 1
after the next shortest one finishes (again changing the job load).
