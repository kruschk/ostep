Given an equal number of equal-length jobs, the FIFO and SFJ policies behave
identically, producing the following response and turnaround times:

- Response time: (0 + 200 + 400) / 3 = 200
- Turnaround time: (200 + 400 + 600) / 3 = 400

This can be confirmed by running the following commands:

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 200,200,200 -p FIFO
    [...]

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 200,200,200 -p SJF
    [...]
