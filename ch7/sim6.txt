Under SJF, as job lengths increase, average response time worsens (increases).
This is because the response time of a given job is determined by the sum of
the lengths of all the jobs that run before it. The trend can be demonstrated
by running the simulator several times with equal-length jobs:

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 1,1 -p SJF
    [...]

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 2,2 -p SJF
    [...]

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 3,3 -p SJF
    [...]

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 4,4 -p SJF
    [...]

    $ ./scheduler.py -c -l 5,5 -p SJF
    [...]

    $ [...]
    [...]
