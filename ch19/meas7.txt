Assuming the OS performs demand zeroing, it will impact the benchmarking
program because a data-clearing penalty will be incurred during the first
access of each page; however, the impact should be effectively imperceptible
due to the large number of trials. The penalty can be further mitigated, if
not outright eliminated, by touching each page before beginning the
benchmarking process.

In this case, the mitigation has no clear effect, probably because calloc was
already used in the original implementation, and the pages were therefore
already being accessed while memory was being cleared.
