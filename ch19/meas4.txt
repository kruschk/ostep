From the plots, the access time on this machine (featuring a good old reliable
Intel i5-750 CPU) is relatively constant at around 8 ns for a wide range of
page accesses. This trend holds until a threshold of approximately 2048 pages,
at which point the access time roughly doubles, reaching about 16 ns. Given
that the OS is configured to use 4 kiB pages, this equates to 2048 * 4096 B =
8,388,608 B = 8 MiB of memory, which, notably, corresponds with the machine's
8 MiB L3 cache. One can therefore conclude that L3 cache misses begin to occur
around this threshold.

It is interesting to note that there aren't clear steps in the plots showing
where the L1 and L2 caches begin to miss, although for very small page counts
the access time does tend to be slightly less than the L3 cache's 8 ns access
time. This may be a problem with the program that will hopefully be addressed
in one of the later questions.

The question posed in the text may be somewhat philosophical, but one view is
that plotting data is a form of compression, distilling information to its
essence so that it can be interpreted more easily. The human mind is also well
adapted to processing visual information, so presenting it in that form
complements one of the natural proclivities of the brain.
