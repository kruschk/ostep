Running free produces the following output:

    $ free -h
                   total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:           7.7Gi       1.9Gi       4.6Gi        65Mi       1.5Gi       5.8Gi
    Swap:          8.0Gi          0B       8.0Gi

From it, we can see that this system can use 7.7 GiB of RAM (ignoring swap
space). This is slightly less than the physical 8 GiB of RAM installed on this
machine because some memory is reserved by the kernel. In other words, one
could state that there is 7.7 GiB of memory in user space. 1.9 GiB is in use,
and 4.6 GiB of memory is free. This is slightly unintuitive because

    used != total - free;

i.e.,

    1.9 GiB != 7.7 GiB - 4.6 GiB = 3.1 GiB.

This is because

    used = total - available,

where available is a slightly different metric: free memory is memory that is
completely unused, while available memory is an estimate of how much memory
can be used without swapping. Free memory can be thought of as wasted memory,
because it's not doing anything productive. See the free man pages and
https://www.linuxatemyram.com/ for details.
