Assuming the logic in figure 20.6 in the text is used, page table accesses
aren't looked up in the TLB, so the question of cache hits or misses is
irrelevant; page table accesses are better thought of as a result of a cache
miss. Indeed, the logic never caches the physical memory location of the page
table; instead, it caches the VPN-to-PTE mapping directly. This is fine,
however, because the next time a virtual address with the same VPN is
referenced, the mapping will (likely) already be cached, leading to a cache
hit and obviating an additional page table access.
