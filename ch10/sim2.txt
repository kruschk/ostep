The job will run much faster because the entire working set fits within the
cache. We can relate the non-caching job time to cold and warm times as
follows:

    noncaching_job_time = cold_time + warm_rate * warm_time

Where noncaching_job_time is the time required to run the job without the
benefit of a caching processor, cold_time is the time required to warm the
cache, warm_rate is the multiplicative speed-up gained when the cache is warm,
and warm_time is the time interval during which the cache is warm.

Rearranging and plugging numbers in yields:

    warm_time = (noncaching_job_time - cold_time) / warm_rate
              = (30 - 10) / 2
              = 10

A caching processor will finish the job in the sum of the cold and warm times:

    caching_job_time = cold_time + warm_time = 10 + 10 = 20
