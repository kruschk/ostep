The cache warms up after 10 ticks, which is the default warm-up time.
Decreasing the warm-up time expedites the onset of the caching performance
boost, thereby reducing the overall run time of the job. Increasing the
warm-up time delays the performance boost, thereby increasing the overall run
time of the job (unless it happes to be shorter than the warm-up time).
