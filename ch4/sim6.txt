After process 0 blocks on I/O, context switches to process 1. Upon completion
of process 1, process 2 runs, followed by process 3. At this point, control
returns to process 0, which issues its other I/O calls and eventually
completes. This is not an effective use of resources because process 0 spends
a lot of time blocked at the end of the simulation with no other activity
occurring. Better utilisation could be achieved by interleaving the
CPU-intensive processes with the I/O-intensive process.
