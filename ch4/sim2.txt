The simulation will take 11 clock cycles: process 0 will run for 4 cycles (all
of which will be in the RUN state), followed by process 1 for 7 cycles (2 of
which will be in the RUN state and 5 of which will be in the BLOCKED state).
The CPU will be busy for 6/11 clock ticks, yielding a utilisation of
approximately 65 %.
