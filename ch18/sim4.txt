After playing with the program for a little while, certain limitations become
clear. Trying to specify a page size larger than the address space is
disallowed:

    $ ./paging-linear-translate.py --asize=4096 --pagesize=8192 --physmem=8192 --seed=0 -c -v
    ARG seed 0
    ARG address space size 4096
    ARG phys mem size 8192
    ARG page size 8192
    ARG verbose True
    ARG addresses -1

    Error in argument: address space must be a multiple of the pagesize

In principle, this situation is possible, as the entire address space could be
placed on a single page.

Despite being a realistic scenario, specifying an address space larger than
physical memory is also not allowed:

    $ ./paging-linear-translate.py --asize=8192 --pagesize=128 --physmem=4096 --seed=0 -c -v
    ARG seed 0
    ARG address space size 8192
    ARG phys mem size 4096
    ARG page size 128
    ARG verbose True
    ARG addresses -1

    Error: physical memory size must be GREATER than address space size (for this simulation)

This is problematic because having a larger address space than physical memory
is very common, especially for 64-bit machines / operating systems.
