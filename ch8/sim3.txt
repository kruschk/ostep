When the number of queues is set to one, the MLFQ behaviour will resemble that
of a round robin scheduler. With this configuration, the allotment period will
have no effect because there are no lower priority queues to bump jobs down
to. Similarly, the boost parameter will also have no effect, because there are
no higher priority queues to bump jobs up to.
