By default, the orphaned sub-tree is flattened and the constituent processes
are grafted onto the root process. When the -R/--local-reparent flag is given,
the sub-tree is instead grafted onto the nearest ancestor up the tree without
being flattened.

Before process C exits, the process tree is as follows:

a
`-b
  `-c
    |-f
    `-e

With the default behaviour, after exiting, the tree becomes:

a
|-b
| `-c
|-f
`-e

When the -R/--local-reparent flag is specified, the tree becomes:

a
`-b
  |-f
  `-e

Here is a slightly more elaborate example, showing the sub-tree flattening (or
lack thereof):

    $ ./fork.py -A a+b,b+c,c+d,c+e,d+f,f+g,d+h,c- -c
    [...]
    a
    ├── b
    ├── d
    ├── f
    ├── g
    ├── h
    └── e

    $ ./fork.py -A a+b,b+c,c+d,c+e,d+f,f+g,d+h,c- -R -c
    [...]
    a
    └── b
       ├── d
       │   ├── f
       │   │   └── g
       │   └── h
       └── e
