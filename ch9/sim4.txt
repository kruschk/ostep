As the time quantum grows, the schedule becomes less fair, because each task,
after winning the lottery, will be given more time to work, thus decreasing
the number of scheduling iterations performed (and thereby lotteries held).
This can be observed by running the simulator with different quanta, e.g.:

    $ ./lottery.py -c -l 100:100,100:100 -q 1
    [...]

    $ ./lottery.py -c -l 100:100,100:100 -q 10
    [...]

    $ ./lottery.py -c -l 100:100,100:100 -q 100
    [...]
